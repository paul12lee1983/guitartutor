      <p>
        I am a professional musician and I’ve been a guitar teacher in and
        around the Swindon area for over 20 years but my love of the guitar has
        been a life long passion. I can’t remember a time when I couldn’t get a
        tune out of the instrument - it really has been my focus from a very
        early age. 
        <br>
        <br>
        After many years sat in my bedroom as a small boy trying to
        ﬁgure out how to play chords and the riffs of the time, my parents
        suggested I join the Guitar Club at my Junior School and that was the
        beginning of years of tuition. Without the help of local guitar teachers
        I’m sure I would not know what I know today - I’m grateful for the help
        and guidance I received from all of them! In Secondary School I was one
        of just a handful of pupils who took his electric guitar in to school
        each day to make music with friends and eventually form a band.
        <br>
        <br>
          Today, it seems that every other child is carrying an instrument of some
          sort and this is always great to see. As learning an instrument becomes
          evermore popular today so does the demand for music teachers with
          genuine passion for helping the next wave of musicians make their mark
          on the music scene. I’ve enjoyed teaching well over a thousand
          guitarists over the years, seeing many of them progress from playing
          their first chord to going on stage and inspiring others to take up the
          challenge of learning how to play guitar. Teaching those with a passion
          for the guitar is a great job - actually it rarely feels like a job at
          all!
          <br>
          <br>
        My studio is located in North Swindon with good access and parking. All lesson are one to one. With recent events due to the pandemic, the studio is COVID-19 safe with cleaning after each session and a protective screen between myself and the student.

      <span class="comment">Andy is a very capable and friendly guitar teacher who really knows
        his stuff when it comes to playing and teaching. He taught many of
        the students at Greendown School when I was Head of Music and helped
        to set up a ‘Rock School’ which was hugely popular. <br />
        Andy and I have worked together on many occasions in both theatres,
        school productions and also studio sessions. I would always
        recommend Andy to anyone wanting to learn the electric guitar and
        he’s always my first choice if I need a great guitar player in the
        orchestra pit!</span>
